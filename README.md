Hello!

My name is Matthew Sanders. I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for data and financial analysis. I enjoy working with data using tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI to discover valuable insights that drive decision-making.

I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Accountancy from Utah Valley University and have 2.5 years of experience in public accounting at Eide Bailly, specializing in R&D and ERC tax credits within their Business Credits & Incentives group.

Since 2017, alongside my time at Eide Bailly and after, I have worked for Hall Labs creating drawings as a patent illustrator to be used in patent applications. I collaborate with patent attorneys and engineers to produce complex drawings to secure IP rights.

Continuously expanding my skill set, I am actively learning advanced techniques relevant to data/financial analyst roles to enhance my ability to derive actionable insights.
